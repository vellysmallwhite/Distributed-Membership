How to Run the Test Cases:
For Best Experience: Run Each Test Case Individually To ensure the best experience 
and to focus on each test case without interference, it's recommended to run each 
test case individually.

Run Test Case 1:

make testcase1

Run Test Case 2:


make testcase2

Run Test Case 3:

make testcase3

Run Test Case 4:

make testcase4

Other Commands Options:

Build the Docker Image: If you just want to rebuild the Docker image without running any tests, use:

make buil

Stop and Clean Up Docker Containers: If you want to stop and remove all the containers from previous runs before starting a new test, use:

make down


Docker Build Command: If you want to manually build the Docker image outside of the Makefile, you can use the following command:


docker build . -t prj3

docker compose -f docker-compose-testcase-1.yml up
Note:
For each test case, ensure that the containers are properly stopped and removed before running a new test to avoid conflicts. This is handled automatically by the down target in the Makefile.
